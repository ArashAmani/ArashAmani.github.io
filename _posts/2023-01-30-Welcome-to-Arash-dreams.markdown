Hi there! this is a first post I have published on my web site! I write about every thing there. My life include job expriences, pain and hopes, love and hate, social and politic in every day life.
This web site is a voice of million kurdish voice that has been forbidden since the past. We are here to rewrite ourself and we do not allow others define us!

Also my dream is a world with diversity that Kurds be free in their land! Kurdistan with railway on Hawraman mountains. Everybody will   speak their thoughts without any fear!
